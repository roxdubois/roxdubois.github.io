You are likely to have heard a lot about this book in the past few weeks. It was seen as one of the more "controversial" contenders in Canada Reads and was agressively defended by Elaine Lui.

It tells the story of Jude who tries his best to get through highschool as a gay teen. He copes with the harsh reality of bullying, violence and not fitting in by imagining a world in which he is a superstar. He responds to punches and insults by blowing kisses and giving permission to take his picture for the newspaper.

Some have found the book shocking and graphic, but I would argue they are from another generation. It's an insightful look at how highschool can perpetuate homophobia, and Jude is a character that shows clearly how hard and destructive it can be on someone.
